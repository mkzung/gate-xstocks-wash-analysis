"""Benford diagnostics for the wash screen, with the statistical context behind
why the post reports the first-digit signal as a comparative Kolmogorov-Smirnov
DISTANCE rather than a p-value.

For each market it prints the KS distance from Benford, the mean absolute
deviation (MAD) with Nigrini's conformity bands, and the chi-square statistic
(df = 8). The point the numbers make:

  - At tens of thousands of trades the chi-square statistic is far above the
    df=8 critical value at p=0.001 (~26.1) for EVERY market, the MSTRX control
    included, so a formal goodness-of-fit p-value rejects Benford everywhere and
    cannot discriminate (large samples over-power the test).
  - MAD likewise lands every market in Nigrini's "nonconformity" band (> 0.015),
    because tokenized-stock trade sizes span too few orders of magnitude to track
    Benford closely in the first place.
  - The KS DISTANCE is what separates them: the washed markets sit 3-10x farther
    from Benford than the control, the excess coming from the one dominant clip.

Pure stdlib + pandas (no scipy); loads the same cached tapes as the screen.
